# Grafana Observability Stack (Alloy + Loki + Mimir)

![Grafana Observability Stack](./diagrams/grafana-olly-stack.jpg)

## Overview

This is a demo observability setup that you can run on either **MacOS** or **Linux**. It uses the latest **Grafana OSS stack**, including:

* **Alloy** (successor to Promtail + Agent) for collecting and forwarding telemetry data
* **Loki** for storing and querying logs
* **Mimir** for storing metrics (Prometheus-compatible)
* **Grafana** for visualization (single pane for metrics + logs)

The goal is to demonstrate how a minimal, self-contained observability stack can be used to collect logs and metrics from a local system using Docker Compose.

## Stack Components

| Component         | Role            | Default Port | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alloy**         | Collector       | `12345`      | Central collector and forwarder of logs and metrics   |
| **Loki**          | Logs backend    | `3100`       | Stores and queries log data                           |
| **Mimir**         | Metrics backend | `9009`       | Stores time-series metrics (Prometheus-compatible)    |
| **Grafana**       | Visualization   | `3000`       | Dashboard for viewing metrics and logs                |
| **Node Exporter** | Metrics source  | `9100`       | Collects host-level metrics from the monitored system |

---

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Unix-like system (Linux or MacOS)

---

## Running the Stack

```bash
# Start all services in detached mode
docker compose up -d

# Shut down and remove volumes
docker compose down -v
```

You should wait a few seconds for all services to initialize.

---

## Accessing the Services

| Service               | URL                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grafana               | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)                 |
| Mimir (Push Endpoint) | `http://localhost:9009/api/v1/push`                            |
| Loki (Push Endpoint)  | `http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push`                       |
| Node Exporter         | [http://localhost:9100/metrics](http://localhost:9100/metrics) |

## Dashboards

### ‚úÖ Node Exporter Full (Auto-Provisioned)

The **Node Exporter Full** dashboard (ID: **1860**) is automatically installed via provisioning using the JSON file placed in the Grafana provisioning folder.

You don‚Äôt need to import it manually ‚Äî simply open Grafana and navigate to the dashboard list to find it ready to use.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of system resource metrics, including:

- CPU usage  
- Memory usage  
- Disk I/O  
- Network throughput  

Ensure your data source is configured to a Mimir or Prometheus-compatible endpoint for the metrics to display correctly.


### üõ†Ô∏è Work in Progress: Loki Logs + Python Log Generator

We are currently working on:

* A **Loki-based dashboard** to view logs forwarded by Alloy from `/var/log/*.log`
* A **Python script** to generate sample logs for testing Loki and filtering scenarios

These will be added soon in the `tools/` and `dashboards/` folders.
